Definition - what is it?
1. Design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 
A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. 
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Usage
1. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. 
Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the 
implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems 
and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns. Often, people 
only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems. 
These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide 
general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.

Types of Design Patterns

Creational Design Patterns - These design patterns are all about class instantiation. 
This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. 
While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, 
object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
1. Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
2. Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
3. Singleton -A class of which only a single instance can exist
4. Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
5. Object Pool - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
6. Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

Structural Design Patterns - These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns 
use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to 
obtain new functionality.
1. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
2. Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
3. Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
4. Bridge - Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
5. Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
6. Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
7. Private Class Data - Restricts accessor/mutator access
8. Proxy - An object representing another object

Behavioral Design Patterns - These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. 
Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between 
objects.
1. Chain of Responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
2. Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
3. Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
4. Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
5. Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
6. Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
7. Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
8. Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
9. State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
10. Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
11. Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
12. Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
