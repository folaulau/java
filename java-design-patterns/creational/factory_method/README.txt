DEFINITION
1. Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. 
This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides 
one of the best ways to create an object.

In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client 
and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

2. Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
