1. Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details and describing things in simple terms. 
For example, a method that adds two integers. The method internal processing is hidden from outer world. 
There are many ways to achieve abstraction in object oriented programming, 
such as encapsulation and inheritance.

2. An abstraction is an act of representing essential features without including background details. 
It is a technique of creating a new data type that is suited for a specific application. 
For example, while driving a car, you do not have to be concerned with its internal working. 
Here you just need to concern about parts like steering wheel, Gears, accelerator, etc.

3. Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. 
It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user. 
If you look at the image here, whenever we get a call, we get an option to either pick it up or 
just reject it. But in reality, there is a lot of code that runs in the background. 
So you don’t know the internal processing of how a call is generated, that’s the beauty of abstraction. 
Therefore, abstraction helps to reduce complexity.
You can achieve abstraction in two ways: Abstract Class and Interface
