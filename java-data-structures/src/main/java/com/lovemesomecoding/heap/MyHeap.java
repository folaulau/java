/**
 * A heap is a binary tree (in which each node contains a Comparable key value), with two special properties:<br>
 * 1. The ORDER property:<br>
 * For every node n, the value in n is greater than or equal to the values in its children<br>
 * (and thus is also greater than or equal to all of the values in its subtrees). 2. The SHAPE property:<br>
 * 1. All leaves are either at depth d or d-1 (for some value d).<br>
 * 2. All of the leaves at depth d-1 are to the right of the leaves at depth d.<br>
 * 3. (a) There is at most 1 node with just 1 child. (b) That child is the left child of its parent, and (c) it is the
 * rightmost leaf at depth d.
